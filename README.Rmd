# High-dimensional propensity score (HDPS)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The primary objective of HDPS is to develop an R-package tailored for conducting High-Dimensional Propensity Score (HDPS) analyses in epidemiological studies. The initial focus of the project is on the CDARS database, a clinical electronic database in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, the package is designed to be versatile and can be adapted for use with other databases too.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hdps from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Cainefm/hdps")
```

## Example

Here we using diagnosis database as an example to illustrate:
Diagnosis records

    </p>

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(hdps)
## basic example code

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
